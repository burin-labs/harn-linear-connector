# AGENTS.md

Pure-Harn connector package for Linear webhooks and GraphQL outbound calls.

Shared connector authoring rules live in the Harn guide:

- [Connector authoring guide](https://github.com/burin-labs/harn/blob/main/docs/src/connectors/authoring.md)

Put shared connector guidance in the Harn guide and keep only
provider-specific notes and local hazards here.

`CLAUDE.md` points here. Edit `AGENTS.md` only.

## Provider notes

- Webhook verification uses `linear-signature` with the Linear webhook secret and enforces the
  provider replay window.
- Delivery IDs come from `linear-delivery`; use them as stable dedupe material when available.
- Default secret IDs are `linear/webhook-secret` for webhook verification and `linear/api-token` for
  outbound API-token auth.
- Linear has no OpenAPI surface. Keep outbound behavior on Harn `std/graphql` helpers unless a
  separate generated GraphQL SDK package is created.
- OAuth access tokens use `Authorization: Bearer`; personal API keys use `Authorization: <api_key>`.
- `search` uses `searchIssues(query:)` first and falls back to `searchIssues(term:)` when a Linear
  GraphQL schema still expects `term`.

## Ecosystem working agreement

- Build ambitious outcomes behind small typed interfaces; give behavior one owner
  and generate or parity-test projections instead of duplicating policy.
- Work autonomously within approved scope. Pause for destructive or production effects,
  exceptional spend, material ambiguity, or new authority.
- Treat stop, wait, stand down, pivot, and steer as control events.
- Use the smallest owning product-path check. Add a falsifier for contested, load-bearing,
  or potentially vacuous claims; record controls, recovery, and blind spots.
- Evidence follows source/artifact identity. Reuse proof when relevant code, build inputs,
  and dependencies are unchanged. Repeat affected checks for relevant changes, failures,
  deployment, or packaging differences. Do not rebuild or recapture solely for main.
- Ship means owning-main integration with terminal merge and applicable release/deploy
  checks. Confirm landed content and result; an open PR is incomplete.
- Use `ship` with a deployed Smart Ship caller; otherwise use `gh pr merge --squash --auto`.
  Never use `--admin`; incidents use `bypass-ci`, `bypass-merge-queue`, or `force-merge`.

`[Connector] Verify the webhook signature before parsing the payload`. The
summary starts with a capital letter and does not end with a period. See
